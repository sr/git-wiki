git-wiki: because who needs cool names when you use git?
========================================================

git-wiki is a wiki that relies on git to keep pages' history
and [Sinatra][] to serve them.

I wrote git-wiki as a quick and dirty hack, mostly to play with Sinatra.
It turned out that Sinatra is an awesome little web framework and that this
hack isn't as useless as I first though since I now use it daily.

However, it is definitely not feature rich and will probably never be because
I mostly use it as a web frontend for `git`, `ls` and `vim`.

If you want history, search, etc. you should look at other people's [forks][],
especially [al3x][]'s one.

Install
-------

The fellowing [gems][] are required to run git-wiki:

- [Sinatra][]
- [mojombo-grit][]
- [HAML][]
- [RDiscount][]

Run with `mkdir ~/wiki && (cd ~/wiki && git init) && ./run.ru -sthin -p4567`
and point your browser at <http://0.0.0.0:4567/>. Enjoy!

<blockquote>
<p>What makes git-wiki so cool is because it is backed by a git store,
you can clone your wiki just like you could any other git repository.
I’ve always wanted a wiki that I could a.) pull offline when I didn’t
have access to the Internets and b.) edit (perhaps in bulk)
in my favorite text editor. git-wiki allows both.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Numerous people have written diff and merge systems for wikis;
TWiki even uses RCS. If they used git instead, the repository would be tiny, and
you could make a personal copy of the entire wiki to take on the plane with you,
then sync your changes back when you're done.</p>
